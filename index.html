            <h2 id="about">About</h2>
            <p>Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud (UK: /ˈræ̃boʊ/, US: /ræmˈboʊ/, French: [ʒɑ̃ nikɔla aʁtyʁ ʁɛ̃bo] ; 20 October 1854 – 10 November 1891) was a French poet known for his transgressive and surreal themes and for his influence on modern literature and arts, prefiguring surrealism. Born in Charleville, he started writing at a very young age and excelled as a student, but abandoned his formal education in his teenage years to run away to Paris amidst the Franco-Prussian War.During his late adolescence and early adulthood, he produced the bulk of his literary output. Rimbaud completely stopped writing literature at age 20 after assembling his last major work, Illuminations.
                Rimbaud was a libertine and a restless soul, having engaged in a hectic, sometimes violent romantic relationship with fellow poet Paul Verlaine, which lasted nearly two years. After his retirement as a writer, he traveled extensively on three continents as a merchant and explorer until his death from cancer just after his thirty-seventh birthday.As a poet, Rimbaud is well known for his contributions to symbolism and, among other works, for A Season in Hell, a precursor to modernist literature.</p>
            <p>Jean-Nicholas-Arthur Rimbaud was born on October 20, 1854 at Charleville in provincial France. When he was 6 years old his family was abandoned by their father, an army captain, and forced into poverty. Rimbaud liked to play with the neighbourhood children, which horrified his mother and she somehow found the means to move them to the better part of town. Not having many playmates there, he concentrated on his studies, yearning to learn more and became a gifted student. In 1870, restless and despondent over the loss of his favorite teacher (who'd left to fight in the Franco-Prussian War), Rimbaud ran away from home. He ran away more than once before finally making it to Paris. Broke, Rimbaud lived on the city streets. Immersed in his rebellion, he denounced women and the church. He lived willingly in squalid conditions, studying immoral poets (such as Baudelaire) and reading voraciously everything from occult to philosophy.</p>
            <p>His own poetic philosophy began to take shape at this time. Rimbaud is also considered to have been one of the creators of the free verse style because of the rhythmic experiments in his prose poems Illuminations (1886). His Sonnet of the Vowels (1871), in which each vowel is assigned a color, helped popularize synesthesia (the description of one sense experience in terms of another), a device widely exploited by the symbolists. The hallucinatory images in The Drunken Boat (1871) and Rimbaud's urging, in Letter from the Seer (1871), that poets become seers by undergoing a complete derangement of the senses also reveal Rimbaud as a precursor of surrealism.</p>
            <p>In 1871 Rimbaud met Verlaine and the two had a relationship, which was almost the undoing of Verlaine. Rimbaud's drug taking and generally unclean living eventually alienated everyone except Verlaine. It was during this time that Rimbaud wrote The Spiritual Hunt, a poem that Verlaine called his masterpiece but that manuscript vanished during the pair's travels.</p>
            <p>In 1872, Verlaine left his wife. He and Rimbaud moved to London. But the relationship started unravelling by 1873, in a drunken arguement Verlaine shot Rimbaud and , Rimbaud called the police. Verlaine was sentenced to prison for 18 months and Rimbaud full of guilt completed A Season in Hell in which he describes his inordinately intense, tortured existence.</p>
            <p>Rimbaud gave up writing before he turned twenty. He wandered Europe before eventually becoming a trader and gunrunner in Ethiopia. Eighteen years later he returned to Marseilles in June of 1891. He died in Marseille, on Nov. 10, 1891 following the amputation of his cancerous right leg .</p>

            <p>Arthur Rimbaud’s impact on French poetry is unparalleled. From his innovative use of free verse to his influence on surrealism, his works ushered a new era of modern literature. Rimbaud’s rebellion against traditional poetic conventions and his embracement of unconventional themes like homosexuality and drug usage continue to inspire readers and writers alike. His impact on literary theory was also profound, with his works introducing new concepts of self-expression and individualism. Rimbaud’s influence can be seen in the works of prominent poets like Paul Verlaine, André Breton, and Robert Lowell.</p>
            <p>Moving on to his influence, Rimbaud’s works continue to be studied and admired in schools and universities across the world. His avant-garde approach to poetry and his use of imagery and symbolism have made his poetry a source of inspiration for generations of artists and writers. Moreover, Rimbaud’s unconventional lifestyle and his rebellious spirit have made him a pop culture icon, appearing in popular music, literature, and movies.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that Rimbaud’s impact was not limited to the literary world only. His persona and his journey as a poet have inspired movements like punk and Beatniks. His legacy continues to influence counterculture and alternative movements, making him an emblem of rebellion and creativity.</p>
